Before integrating:

* Create a [target $SERVICE_LONG][create-service]. You need [your connection details][connection-info] to follow this procedure.

  This procedure also works for [self-hosted $TIMESCALE_DB][enable-timescaledb].

[create-service]: /getting-started/:currentVersion:/services/
[enable-timescaledb]: /self-hosted/:currentVersion:/install/
[connection-info]: /use-timescale/:currentVersion:/integrations/query-admin/find-connection-details/
